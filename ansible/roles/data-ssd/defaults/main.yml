# Data SSD Role - Mounts an SSD with UUID-based mounting for boot reliability
#
# Why UUID mounting? Device names like /dev/nvme0n1 can change between reboots due to:
# - Non-deterministic kernel enumeration order during boot
# - Hardware initialization timing variations
# - PCI bus scanning order differences
# UUID-based mounting ensures the correct device is always mounted regardless of device name.
#
# REQUIRED: Must be set in inventory
# data_ssd_device: "/dev/nvme1n1"  # The block device to format and mount
#                                   # WARNING: All data will be lost if formatted!
#
# Optional configuration (defaults shown)
data_ssd_mount_point: "/mnt/ssd"   # Where to mount the filesystem
data_ssd_filesystem: "ext4"        # Filesystem type

# Ext4 mkfs options for SSD optimization
data_ssd_mkfs_options:
  - "-F"  # Force creation
  - "-E lazy_itable_init=0,lazy_journal_init=0"  # Speed up mkfs
  - "-L {{ data_ssd_label }}"  # Set filesystem label

# Mount options for SSD optimization
data_ssd_mount_options:
  - "defaults"
  - "noatime"  # Don't update access times (better SSD performance)
  - "discard"  # Enable TRIM support
  - "errors=remount-ro"

# Filesystem label
data_ssd_label: "homelab-data"

# Safety settings
data_ssd_force_format: false  # Set to true to force formatting even if filesystem exists
